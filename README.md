# Linux Traffic & Security Monitor

A collection of lightweight shell scripts designed to protect Linux servers (specifically Ubuntu/Oracle Cloud) from automated attacks, DDoS attempts, and rapid-fire requests.

## 🚀 Overview

These scripts monitor your Apache/Web server access logs in real-time. If an IP address exceeds a set threshold of requests within a single minute, the system automatically triggers a permanent ban using `fail2ban`.

### Key Features
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Scans access logs for traffic spikes.
- **Auto-Banning**: Automatically interfaces with `fail2ban-client` to ban malicious IPs.
- **WhatsApp Alerts**: Sends detailed reports to your phone via [Clawdbot].
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Easily adjust the sensitivity (e.g., ban after 60 requests/min).
- **Lightweight**: Pure Bash and AWK — no heavy dependencies.
